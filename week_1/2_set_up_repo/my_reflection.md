## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) First you need to go on Github and create a repository. There will be a “create new” button next to your username at the top of the page. From there, click new repository. You will need to enter a name and add the MIT license. After you created the repository, you will need to clone it to your computer so that it has access to the repository. If you do not, the repository will only be on Github.com. There are two ways you can clone it. One way is through your terminal and the other way is through the Github app. If you use the Github app, you should see the repository you created, and there will be a clone button next to it.  After you click that, you have officially cloned the repository onto your computer.

2) Open source is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit (seeing the actual code). For most programs that exist, we only have access to the output and not the the input. For example, we can get access to an app but we would not be able to get the code that makes the app. With open source, it allows others to freely see the code, and allow them to use and work with the code. 

3) I like the idea of open source, however I can see why other would want to keep the code hidden and private. I think a little bit of both will allow the future of programming and coding to progress. 

4) Personally, I do not see the reason why you would need a license for open source. If it was meant to be free to use to anyone, why would you need a license to let it be free? I can understand how copyright and license come into play when keeping a code/program private, but I don

5) I kind of had an aha moment when cloning your repository so that it would be available for local use. I still have some trouble determining where files end up, but the articles and guide have helped clear it up a bit. I did have a lot of trouble when I was making my first web page. I had a hard time finding the correct folders. But after a really long time of searching through my computer, I was able to locate them.
