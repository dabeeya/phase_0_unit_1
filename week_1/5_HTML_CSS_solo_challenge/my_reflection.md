1) I had some questions trying to define what a footer/sidebar and etc was. I was trying to figure out if they had a specific code we had to follow. However, after joining multiple offices hours, I was able to learn that a side bar was just an element that existed on the side of the page and that a footer was just on the bottom of the webpage.
2) I think I had the most trouble with floating elements. I had a hard time trying to figure out how to move them around and the specific code that they required.
3) I learned a lot in the lesson. I realized I had to take things one step at a time. It took me a while to figure out each topic as I read the slides from GirlDevelopIt. Something new I learned was that you can customize the links you put on a webpage. For example, I could make the link a different color instead of the standard blue that most pages use. I found that pretty interesting and cool.
4) I would say I'm about 50% confident. Even after hours of reading and working on the solo challenege, my brain hasn'y fully absorbed everything. I still need to recheck slides and websites to make sure I am writing the correct syntax.
5) The part that I enjoyed the most was being able to see what I was doing. After each line of code I added, I could simply just save it and sync it to the master branch and check to see if the code did what I wanted it to do.
6) The parts I found most tedious was trying out each values so that I could find the right one. For example, I used a guess and check method when I wanted to figure out the height and width I wanted for a div. If it was too big, I had to choose a smaller random number and double check my webpage to see if it was the correct measurement.
