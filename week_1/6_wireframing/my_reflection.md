1) I learned what design thinking was. To define is simply and with non-technical terms: 1) define the problem 2) Create and consider many options 3) Refine selected directions 4) Pick winner and execute 

2) I really enjoyed the process of design and user experience. I thought design thinking is a fantastic process to help solve problems. I'm pretty certain that I have used design thinking in solving many of my own problems, but I just did not know that there was a name for it. I thought it was pretty fun engaging in the wire framing process. Although I'm not the most creative, Balsamiq did a fantastic job in giving multiple templates for me to use. I definitely can see how this can serve to be an important process to many. However, I can also see how some do not really need to spend much time wire framing as others. It really all depends on how your mind works. For me, I feel that I will have to use wire framing a bit, because I would probably not be able to start my coding off a sketch I draw.

3) Some questions I had was that I wonder which wireframe program most web developers used. I also wondered how important and unimportant wire framing can be to certain developers. 

4) I learned how to play around with Balsamiq. I think itâ€™s a great tool and seems pretty user friendly. It didn't take much for me to get comfortable with the wire frame program. It is important to note that I probably used the very basics of Balsamiq though. Nonetheless, I enjoyed myself quite a bit.

5) I feel pretty confident in the learning competencies for this challenges. The articles and websites were much more detailed and made it easy to understand the material

6) I enjoyed being able to throw in what I wanted and taking out things that I did not see to fit. Wire framing is a nice process because it allows a developer to know what they want their webpage to look like. Think of how much time someone could spend on writing a piece of syntax, but deciding that it did with fit in with the overall design. 

7) Wire framing is like art. The more tedious and detailed you are, the better overall picture you can create. I felt that Balsamiq had so many options that entering them all felt like forever.
