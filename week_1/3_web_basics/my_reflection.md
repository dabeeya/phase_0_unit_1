## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) It’s funny how I knew that the internet and web were different but I never really knew how to distinguish them. The internet is basically defined as the system of interconnected computer networks. Another thing I learned was about IP address but I never knew that IP addresses were linked to domain names. It was pretty interesting reading how all these different terms incorporated with one another. I always thought IP address were just numbers your computer needed to access the Internet. But obviously, it has more complex process than that.
2) I think it is very important not to forget to sync your changes to Github. If you do not sync your changes that you committed, then it will not show up on Github. 
3) To be honest, it felt pretty exhilarating to see it live. Although it was just a simple web page that just contained a single sentence, it was amazing knowing that I made it. I did not know how much work it would take just to make that simple web page. However, it lets me know that this is a start to a very challenging yet extremely satisfying work.
4) There was one moment where I had trouble finding the repositories I cloned from Github. It took me a really long time to find them, and I wasn’t able to make my web page until I did. However, once I was able to locate them, the task in making a webpage became pretty simple. Also, I learned that you had to be careful in the way you named your repository.
5) No
