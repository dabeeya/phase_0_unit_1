2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I'm not sure if I missed something but I have not seen where we were required to write regarding DBC. But I guess I'll take some time to write my response here. I'm pretty nervous about entering and starting at DBC. It worries me because I always feel like I'm falling behind. I think it might be better once classes start because then we would have an instructor to talk to in person. However, I do know that it will only get more intense once we start in NYC. But everyone here has been extremely welcoming. It's great to meet such nice and motivated people. This week was tough for me. I definelty thought I spent a lot of time working on the materials but I still could grasp a lot of the concepts. I had so many questions and sometimes the office hours were not sufficient. But at times they were, and I truly apprecaited that. In the end, I realized that I love challenging myself. And the more I fall behind, the more I push myself to get better.
