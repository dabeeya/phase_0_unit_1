## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) So far, most of the things I've read on HTML seems to make sense. The only problem I've had was trying to comprehend the slide shows and intro guides at certain. I feel like with my 0 experience in computer programming, it's made reading these webpages and guides a bit more difficult because of their wording. I find myself lost and rereading the same sentence over and over again. I felt that the instructions these sites gave just had me confused at times. I actually had a lot of issues trying to link my css file to my html file. The way it was explained online did not seem to be sufficient enough for me. I also realized why 
2) It's interesting to see how HTML and CSS have to work side by side. I would of thought HTML would of found some effiecent way to present your material better without having to use CSS, but I guess there must be a lot of options in CSS that make it a more viable option. I do understand that if you want to change a page, it is fine to use CSS in the html file but still, I would of thought that there would be a better way.
3) I had an aha moment when I understood how to link CSS file and html file linked up togehter (internally and externally) It might have been once I knew the process of physically linking the css file, the concept seem to get a little more familar.
