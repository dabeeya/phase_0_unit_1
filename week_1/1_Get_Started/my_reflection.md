## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

1)Some struggles I had came from installfest webpage that guided us on how to download many of the programs we would need to use (such as Ruby, Rails, Sublime 2 and etc). It may just be me, but I feel like having different sources telling me what to download had brought me some issues. I feel as if some of the programs have not been completely installed and updated because of this confusion. 

2) Git allows a person to keep track of changes. For example, let's say you were working on a word document and edited a couple of paragrahs. After you finished editing, you saved the document only to realize that one of the paragraphs you edited was completely wrong and you wanted to change it back to what you originally had. However, because you already saved the document, you would not be able to get the original paragraph back unless you you wanted. Git allows you to keep track of the changes you already made, and even help you get back what you needed. It also allows you and a partner (or mutiple partners) to work on a project together at the same time without having to worry if you deleted someone elses work. Github is just a social website that allows users to share their projects with others while incorporating git. 

3) Version control allows you to keep track of the changes you made to a file (ex. Git). Github is a social coding website that allows developers to share their code and keep track of their changes uing git (which is a control verison system).

4)Sometimes developers will work in a team on a big project that will require thousands of lines of coding. Using version control allows the team to work on the same project at the same time, while not having to worry about deleting or changing each others lines. It makes sense because if the file was like a word document, the project would take much longer because of simple mistakes people make.

5)The whole idea of Git and Github is such an ingenious idea. It totally makes sense and I can see why it serves well in the developer world.
