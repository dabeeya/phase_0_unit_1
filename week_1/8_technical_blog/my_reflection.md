Blog url: http://dabeeya.github.io/phase_0/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I wasn't too fond of the whole blog process. I guess it just the fact that I dont like writing in  general. It was never one of my strong suits and it will probably never be. Doing the research on each site was ok, but I kind of felt we were going off course when we had to write about the blogs. I mean I understand that it's important to look at a website now with a technical view, but still I kind of saw this as a dry process. However, making the blog made me practice the material I learned this week.
