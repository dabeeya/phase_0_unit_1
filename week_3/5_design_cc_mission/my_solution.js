// I worked [by myself, with:] on this challenge

// Your mission description:
// The mission is to find the princess in a specific, and then fight an orge to get away. However, Tharin
// cannot defeat the orge with brute force. The ogre asks a riddle and will let him pass if he answers 
// correctly.

// Pseudocode
// Tharin walks up 2x
// Tharin walks right 2x
// Tharin calls the princess
// Tharin attacks the ogre that entered room
// Tharin answers riddle

// Initial Code
var this = {Tharin};
var princess = "Princess";
var ogre = "Ogre";
var riddle = true;

// Reflection
// - So I wanted to make a pretty simple mission with the material I learned, so I went back to code combact to try and
// create a mission similar to the ones we had to complete. But I also wanted to add a twist with Tharin having to
// answer a riddle. Some problems I faced was that I was not sure if I was able to check this code to see if 
// if there were any issues with the code. Also, I felt that because I used really simple code, there was
// nothing to really refactor.
// - I think I'm having some trouble understanding the flow of the code I created. I feel like if we were to run
// this, the system would crash because I left something out or that the code just didnt make snese.
// - I was able to use the prompt screen which we learned about when reading the intro guide to Javascript which
// I thought was a pretty cool function. 
// - I am not too confident about this challenge. I'm not sure if the syntax I wrote would work. I was not sure
// if there was a way to test to make sure there wasn't a mistake.
// - I found this challegene to be pretty exciting. It allowed me to have to be creative and incorporate my creativenss
// with the code I had to create. 
// - I found the psuedcoding to be pretty tedious because I almost felt that it was kind of uncessary.
