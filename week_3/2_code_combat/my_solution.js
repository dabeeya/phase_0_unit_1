1. In code combat, "this" is referring to the knight. In Javascript, this 
usually refers to an object. The object in code combats case is a variable.
2. The () are used to hold the parameters in the function. 
3. The point of semicolons is let Javascript know that we are ending the statement. In Ruby, using ; was not 
as mandatory. However, it seems that in Javascript, we will need to use the semicolon much more often, if 
not all the time.

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
- There weren't any real issues or problems I had to face when engaging in code combat because it was a
simple intro to Javascript. I just had to follow the instructions and use logical reasoning. 
What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
- A question I had while coding was what the parenthesis were there for. I found it quite puzzling that
they were just blank for all of the code we wrote. However, when I started the next section I realized 
what they were for.
What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
- From this section, there wasn't anything that I had trouble with. 
Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
- Not really. I learned some extreme basics of Javascript.
How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
- So far I feel pretty confident with the first 2 sections of week 3. However, I also did get a lot of help
during office hours. I still need to practice and reread the guides and articles given from DBC.
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
- I found code combat pretty interesting. I think it was pretty fun because it was very interactive and had
me seeing what each piece of code did. Even though it was a pretty basic tutorial, I enjoyed it because it 
have me feeling lost. It was a great way to introduce Javascript, at least in my opinion. 
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
- I found writing each syntax for each mission very tedious especially because it became quite repetitious. Even
though we were learning something new each mission, we still had to write each syntax over and over again.
