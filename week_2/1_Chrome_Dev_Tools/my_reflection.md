# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) The DOM is an interface that someone could use to basically use the code that was created for a webpage and make any changes you would like. Although you can make changes, you have to remember that the changes will not actually be set and stone. It is used for your personal use. It makes a lot a sense and I think that its a really cool tool to have by yourside. You could really get the code for any site and play with it, making any changes you please. I do find it a little scary how the one can easily access the program though.

3) I found DevtTool pretty fun and helpful to use. I cannot wait until I get much for proficient at it. I think once I am more accustomed to using DevTools, I will have a lot many more options in exploring different web sites. But it was pretty painful trying to learn the different tools and functions DevTools had. 
4) I think I had an "aha" when playing around with the networks and performance. I found it cool how FPS or frames per second was incorporated into the devtools course. I play video games here and there so I definitely knew what FPS was. But it was really interesting to see how FPS was also used in the performance section of DevTools. 
5) Just used the resources I was given from DBC.
