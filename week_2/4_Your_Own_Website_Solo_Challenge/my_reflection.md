# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) User experience is how a person feels when interacting with a system. I think it was particularly interesting how UX design is not a one size fits all. I guess it was kind of common sense because not every single person is the same, so UX design may have certain effects on one person than on another. I also found it interesting how you cannot directly assess UX with traditional metrics. We can use assumptions to see if the UX design is for the better or worse, but there is nothing that can truly define the effectiveness in a unit. 
2. I do. It definitely puts more of a personality on a webpage. Although I cannot exactly do the things I want with my knowledge and experience, I think my webpage looks much better from last week. It wasn’t too bad working on my site. But the process was definitely difficult that had a lot of speed bumps on the way. 
3. When I first began the wire frame, I had my webpage much more complex. However, because this is the 2nd week of learning programming/web development/etc., I was very limited to what I wanted to accomplish. So I had to go back to my wireframe and simplify it a bit. So after I decided on having some standards (header, sidebar and etc.), I tried to incorporate some of the materials we have learned this week. 
4. I think I would like to change the image and make it more of an image that serves as a background. Then, I would use colored font to write over the image for whatever content I need. I will also need to find a much simpler design that has a solid base so that it won’t throw the writing.  
5. It kind of was. Learning and understanding the concept hasn't been too difficult for me. The biggest issue has been just writing out the syntax. I wish there were instructors that helped me put everything together so I could grasp everything more efficiently. However, I am coping the best I can.
