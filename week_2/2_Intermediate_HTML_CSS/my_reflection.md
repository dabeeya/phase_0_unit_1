# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) Web standards are rules and guidelines established by W3C to promote a consistency in the design flow. Simply, it's the guideline of the mark-up language which determines how a web page displays in a visitors browsers window. I think it's a good concept because of the fact that many people will use different browsers. Some will use IE, others Firefox and Chrome. So it is important that a website will keep a consistent flow in each browser. 
2) Standard structure does make sense. It gives people a format that you can use to have the content of your webpage look nice throughout any browser.  
3) I am not really a big fan of HTML5 because I couldn’t really understand the outline algorithm that well. However, it does seem like a much more efficient way of setting your webpage. 
4) When there was no standardization, each web browser implemented what if felt was right. Different browsers had different styles, and used its own parameters. If these styles are not "reset", you will see unwanted styles/effects and things breaking. The "reset" actually "resets" all these styles to none, so that you don't see any styles you haven't applied in your page. It’s always recommended to "reset" the browser's styles.
5) I used to use Firefox a very long time ago but I have since then switched to Chrome. I do not recall any instances where the browsers made a specific website look different. But if that does happen, I think that it is a bad thing. I believe in consistency, so when the webpage comes up differently on a different browser, that would cause a lot of issues. I think it's important for the company to have the same consistent look on any platform or browser they use. 
6) Not really, I had to use stackoverflow.com to kind of get me going towards the right path here and there. Also, I had to use a tutor session to help me understand CSS reset.
