# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) A responsive web design allows smooth transitions for the webpage so that the design fits nicely depending on which device you are using (mobile, table, pc etc.) I think it is a phenomenal practice. Today, people use so many different platforms to access the Web. Almost everyone has a smart phone, and tablets are widely used all around. So it's important for the design of the website to match each platform. We saw that sometimes a fixed page does not transition well into a mobile device. Using a responsive web design changes that, allowing the viewing experience to be much more pleasurable. 
2) Smartphones and tablets have changed web design because it has given designers a new platform to work with. These days, almost everyone has a smartphone. Some elementary kids are even given smartphones! Before, designers had to create a page specifically for a PC, smartphone and tablet. However, responsive web design has changed that. I cannot see how this new technology can further change web design, but I guess we'll just have to wait and see. 
3) From quick research and a short brain storm, one way the visually impaired use the Web is from using a screen reader. Basically, a program could read the content of the webpage out loud, word by word. I think there should be a minimum amount of design and development based on this process. Unless there is another method that I have not learned of, it seems like there is no need to make the design more complex than it needs to be for the visually impaired.
4) The idea of responsive makes sense. It allows the programmer to make one file of code rather than making multiple pages specified for each platform. Now that I've learned about this topic, I cannot see what function a fixed page would have. It just wouldn't make any sense to me. 
5) I have just used the resources given by DBC.
